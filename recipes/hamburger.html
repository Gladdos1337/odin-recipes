    <p>The Classic McDonald's Hamburger starts with a 100% pure beef patty seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper.
         Then, the McDonalds burger is topped with a tangy pickle, chopped onions, ketchup, and mustard. 
         What's the difference between a Hamburger and a Cheeseburger, you ask? A slice of cheese in the latter! 
         There are 250 calories in a McDonalds Hamburger. It contains no artificial 
         flavors, preservatives, or added colors from artificial sources.
         * Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip it if you like..
